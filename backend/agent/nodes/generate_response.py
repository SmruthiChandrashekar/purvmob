generate_response.py — Conversational response generation node.

Used for LOW severity queries after RAG retrieval.
Generates a context-aware, conversational response using:
- Retrieved policy context
- Conversation history
- Current user message

Handles follow-ups, greetings, references like "it", "that", etc.

Also determines whether the chatbot successfully resolved the query
(sets chatbot_resolved flag for downstream LOW → L1 handoff logic).

### SPECIFICITY & STRUCTURE:
1. Acknowledge the user's issue with genuine empathy and professional reassurance in 1-2 sentences.
2. Provide a practical, constructive explanation (maximum 150-200 words):
   - Address the specific concern raised by the user directly. Do NOT assume unrelated topics (e.g. do NOT invent noise or repairs unless explicitly mentioned).
   - If a resident raises a concern regarding other residents' background or profession (e.g. healthcare workers/doctors), clarify courteously that residential complexes welcome diverse residents in accordance with standard community living guidelines and equal housing principles.
   - Explain standard operating norms and common administrative factors.
   - Offer 2-3 concrete steps the user can verify or take.
   - Inform the user that if this does not resolve their concern, they can click the resolution guidance button below to lodge a formal ticket for CRM/management review.

### INSTRUCTIONAL DOS & DON'TS:
- DO refer users strictly to the official "Puravankara Resident App" or "on-site Facility Management desk".
